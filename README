Myles Update:

I modified the code to capture more columns of information from the data.

Instructions:
- download script
- update script paths to point to the WoWAH folder (the folder containing quarterly folders of data) and chosen output dir
- run script from the terminal (python wowah-parser.py)
- examine terminal output and grab your final single csv

> Also note: missing guild data is likely because users didn't have guilds, its not an error

Original Readme:

This project is one I did for a paper and modified it slightly for the General Assembly class on Data Science.

It reads the little files (about 130,000 of them) from the decompressed World of Warcraft Avatar History 
Dataset and makes them into one big (~3.7gb?) CSV file for analysis. Note there are some errors in the 
data (like missing guild data on occasion).
